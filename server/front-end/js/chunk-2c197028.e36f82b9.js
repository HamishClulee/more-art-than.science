As it stood, custom\n                dashboards required a lot of back and forth to build a solid specification, and then a \n                reasonably long lead time to complete development.","As a team we identified elements of dashboards that were commonly requested, and \n                found a large number that could be further generalised past the loose components that were in \n                place at the time.","I prototyped an app that would allow creation of dashboards without needing developers. \n                The prototype was picked up and approved by management, I was lucky enough to be given \n                leadership of the project, and the Dashboard Builder was born.","The Dashboard Builder allowed customers to create pages, sections, and widgets. \n                Sections were contained on pages, widgets were contained in sections.","Widgets were split in to two groups, display and input. For example, display widgets \n                included line, spline, area and bar graphs built using c3.js and d3.js, a table widget for \n                displaying pure tabular data, and a tile widget for displaying single items; think fastest \n                100m sprint this week, or monthly average caloric \n                intake.","All of the widgets had customisable icons, color pickers for background, title and subtitle colors \n                and were able to be repositioned in, and into new sections \n                and pages via drag and drop.","In addition to the working on the frontend I built the API in Java, the deploy and \n                integrations pipeline (using shell scripts and \n                gitlab in conjunction with amazon CDN) and the developement environment, which needed to \n                mock the production API and the save and publish \n                functionality of the editor and viewer (this was done using NodeJS and some npm hackery), \n                finally I built the storage layer in Java, so the JSON object from the frontend could be stored and \n                retrieved in and from our PSQL database.","The Dashboard Builder was a big win from a business perspective, devs were freed up, and the backlog was cleared. \n                From conversations I've had with friends who still work at Fusion I'm told that the Dashboard Builder \n                continues to be a customer favorite.
