If code is well line wrapped, it’s also less likely to contain bugs, because you are not hiding things off screen.</p>\\n<p>This doesn&#39;t need to be done manually, the VSCode prettier extension has really good Vue support and does an excellent job at automating formmating.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"not-using-the-same-nodej-version-between-code-bases\\\">Not using the same NodeJ version between code bases</h3>\\n<p>Swicthing between projects should be easy - pull repo, checkout branch, npm install, run dev - write code - should be quick, quick enough that you don&#39;t feel like you have to go and make a coffee after you run dev. You should be able to say to any other FE dev, “Run my branch and see what I mean” and they should be able to do this very quickly, having the same Node version is a big part of this. </p>\\n<p>Generally this problem arises when SCSS/SASS is in use, if you are not using pre-processors, then you can probably ignore this. </p>\\n<p>Node 12.x is an even version number, which means it&#39;s an LTS version, Long Term Stable release. This means bugs in Node get fixed but the Node maintainers. It also means that when we upgrade our build systems, there is one less thing to do.</p>\\n<p>I suggest using the <code>nvm</code> package, Node Version Manager. Instal it then say <code>nvm current</code> and see the output, if you are interesting in correctness you should see <code>12.xx.xx</code> or <code>14.xx.xx</code>. The most importnat thing here is seeing the same across team members.</p>\\n<p>TL;DR - install <code>nvm</code> then say:</p>\\n<p><code>nvm install 12.16.1 &amp;&amp; nvm alias default 12.16.1</code></p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"not-providing-a-key-when-using-v-for\\\">Not providing a :key when using v-for</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47978853/whats-a-unique-key-in-vue-js-used-for\\\">For reference</a> and <a href=\\\"https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#key\\\">the docs</a></p>\\n<p>Basically, if you write a v-for you need to provide a key</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\">    &lt;my-awesome-component\\n        class=&quot;intelligent-reusable-class-name&quot;\\n        v-for=&quot;(value, index) in listOfThings&quot;\\n        :key=&quot;index&quot;\\n    &gt;&lt;/my-awesome-component&gt;</code></pre>\\n<p>If you read the docs carefully, you will that there are some higher end performance use cases where you would \\nnot use a <code>:key</code>.

Even if you&#39;re using a framework like vuetify or \\nvue-bootstrap (which I don&#39;t encourage or agree with, but regardless), that shouldn&#39;t mean that you never write new \\ncustom components. Common cases - when using a framework- would be things like wrapper components for commonly used \\ngroups of framework components, if you are often using a set of two or three buttons, write a wrapper component \\ncalled HorizontalButtonWrapper, or writing v-if / v-else blocks in a top level router component, use a component to \\nwrap the logic and reduce the number of lines in the template block.</p>\\n<p>Anytime you find you self using CTRL+C CTRL+V - write a new component, and reuse code rather than using the same \\ncode twice! One of the main advantages of using an SPA framework like Vue is code reusage. Components are how \\nthat advantage is manifested. It also provides developers the ability to really reduce bundle sizes if used \\ncorrectly.</p>\\n<p>There is a limit to how far you should go, having thousands of files in your repository that are very rarely \\nused is just another symptom of inexperience or disorganised thinking. But what I have seen much more of is \\nhuge Vue files, with a ton of spagetti code making debugging or refactoring much much slower, and as above, \\nfully ignoring one of the main benefit&#39;s of using Vue in the first place.</p>\\n<p>The more code you resuse, the less bugs you will create.</p>\\n<p>The more code you resuse, the less unit tests you will have to write.</p>\\n<p>The smaller your unit&#39;s of code, the eaiser they will be to test.</p>\\n<p>Anytime you find you self using CTRL+C CTRL+V - write a new function, and reuse code rather than using the same code twice!</p>\\n<h5 id=\\\"some-examples\\\">Some examples</h5>\\n<p><strong>Bad</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\">&lt;template&gt;\\n  &lt;div class=&quot;row-container&quot;&gt;\\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row-item-container one&quot;&gt;\\n      &lt;div class=&quot;row-item-actual&quot;&gt;{{ someData }}&lt;/div&gt;\\n    &lt;/div&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row-container&quot;&gt;\\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row-item-container two&quot;&gt;\\n      &lt;div class=&quot;row-item-actual&quot;&gt;{{ someOtherData }}&lt;/div&gt;\\n    &lt;/div&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row-container&quot;&gt;\\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row-item-container three&quot;&gt;\\n      &lt;div class=&quot;row-item-actual&quot;&gt;{{ someMoreData }}&lt;/div&gt;\\n    &lt;/div&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Good</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\">&lt;template&gt;\\n  &lt;div\\n    class=&quot;row-container&quot;\\n    :class=&quot;value.className&quot;\\n    v-for=&quot;(value, index) in computedProperty&quot;\\n    :key=&quot;index&quot;\\n  &gt;\\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row-item-container&gt;\\n      &lt;div class=&quot;row-item-actual&quot;&gt;{{ value.data }}&lt;/div&gt;\\n    &lt;/div&gt;\\n  &lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">default {\\n  computed: {\\n    computedProperty() {\\n      return [\\n        { value: this.someData, className: &#39;one&#39; },\\n        { value: this.someOtherData, className: &#39;two&#39; },\\n        { value: this.someMore∂Data, className: &#39;three&#39; }\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Even Better</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\">&lt;template&gt;\\n  &lt;row-container\\n    class=&quot;row-container&quot;\\n    :class=&quot;value.className&quot;\\n    v-for=&quot;(value, index) in computedProperty&quot;\\n    :key=&quot;index&quot;\\n    :dataAsProp=&quot;value.data&quot;\\n  &gt;&lt;/row-container&gt;\\n&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">default {\\n  computed: {\\n    computedProperty() {\\n      return [\\n        { value: this.someData, className: &#39;one&#39; },\\n        { value: this.someOtherData, className: &#39;two&#39; },\\n        { value: this.someMore∂Data, className: &#39;three&#39; }\\n      ]\\n    }\\n  }\\n}</code></pre>\\n<p>Anytime you can reduce code reusage, you are actually <em>saving time</em>.

Let’s fix that! </p>\\n<p>Dealing with warnings, from the Developer Console, from Webpack, from NPM and from VSCode extentions really can reduce the amount of time we spend fixing bugs… by a lot.</p>\\n<p>Try to fix one warning per day.

If you can’t fix it so the warning goes away, contact one of the more senior guys, then work it out together.</p>\\n<p>If you think the eslint configuartion is wrong, talk to your team lead and change the configuration to reflect your reasoning.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"use-forceupdate\\\">Use $forceUpdate</h3>\\n<p>99% of the time <code>$forceUpdate()</code> is not the correct solution, you can achieve the same results using <code>:key</code> and <code>$set()</code>, and sometimes <code>$nextTick()</code>.</p>\\n<p>There is almost never a reason to reload an entire component tree.</p>\\n<p>If you find your self in a position in which you realy want to use it, contact me or one of the senior guys to work out a way to get around the problem. <code>$forceUpdate()</code> can easily trigger a full page reload, which is super bad for user experience, and makes a Single Page Application behave the same way a standard HTML SSR app would behave. Not good - and can always be fixed using other Vue API methods.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"include-magic-numbers-and-string-literals\\\">Include Magic Numbers and String Literals</h3>\\n<p><strong>Bad</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">const foo = 300000\\nthis.bar = &#39;some awesome string&#39;</code></pre>\\n<p><strong>Good</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">import { AWESOME_CONST } from &#39;../constants/time.js&#39;\\n\\nconst FIVE_MINUTES = 1 * 1000 * 60 * 60 // Five minutes in miliseconds\\nthis.bar = AWESOME_CONST</code></pre>\\n<p>Pretty simple: There shouldn’t be any numbers floating around the code base, declare a variable with a descriptive name and explanatory comment, same for strings, literals can’t be internationalised at a later date and magic numbers are hard to understand if you did not write them.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"using-unnecessary-template-blocks\\\">Using unnecessary <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> blocks</h3>\\n<p><strong>Bad</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\">&lt;template v-if=&quot;someThing&quot;&gt;\\n  &lt;template v-if=&quot;someOtherThing &amp;&amp; anotherThing || somethingElse&quot;&gt;\\n    &lt;div&gt;\\n      // some content here\\n    &lt;/div&gt;\\n  &lt;/template&gt;\\n&lt;template&gt;</code></pre>\\n<p>Templates are invisible elements provided by VueJs to allow for grouping elements together. You dont need a template to use v-if or v-show. You can use v-if and v-show on any element!  </p>\\n<p><strong>Also Bad</strong></p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\">&lt;template v-if=&quot;something&quot;&gt;\\n  &lt;cool-component\\n    v-for=&quot;(datas, index) in arrayOfData&quot;\\n    :key=&quot;index&quot;\\n  &gt;&lt;/cool-component&gt;\\n&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>\\n<p>Using a template because you can’t use v-if and v-for on the same element. Much easier to use a computed property and Array.filter() or Object.keys()</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\">&lt;cool-component\\n  v-for=&quot;(datas, index) in filteredArrayOfData&quot;\\n  :key=&quot;index&quot;\\n&gt;&lt;/cool-component&gt;</code></pre>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">computed: {\\n  filteredArrayOfData() {\\n    return arrayOfData.filter(value =&gt; {\\n      return value !== something\\n    })\\n  }\\n}</code></pre>\\n<p>It will perform faster, it&#39;s easier to read and you are using the Vue API correctly.</p>\\n<p>There is really only one place where you should be using a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> when you want to group a number of elements together for conditional visibility.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\">&lt;template v-if=&quot;something&quot;&gt;\\n  &lt;div&gt;{{ someOtherData }}&lt;/div&gt;\\n  &lt;cooler-component&gt;&lt;/cooler-component&gt;\\n  &lt;span&gt;{{ fooBar }}&lt;/span&gt;\\n&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"use-important-when-we-dont-need-to\\\">Use <code>!important</code> when we don’t need to</h4>\\n<p>Anytime you find you self using <code>!important</code> you are probably in the wrong. When you find your self in a position in which you feel like you have to use the <code>!important</code> rule, it is generally because the structure of the CSS/SCSS files in your code base is incorrect. The biggest thing to remember is that CSS built as a hieracy, the reason you have to use <code>!important</code> is either because someone else used it before you (which leads to a never ending battle in CSS of over ridding rules using <code>!important</code>) or, because third party vendor CSS files have been included too far down in the CSS hieracy.</p>\\n<p>I admit that some times you will have to use <code>!important</code> - but - before you use it, take a moment and ask your self why you are having to use it.</p>\\n<p>It&#39;s much better to fix the problem than avoid it. If you look at the CSS rules in the browser developer console, can you see if you’re over ridding a rule from a Vendor css file, or a rule that we wrote. If it’s a Vendor rule, then look at where it&#39;s being imported, is it in main.js? If it is, is it imported before, or after the file you are currently working on? </p>\\n<p>If you can’t work out why your having to use <code>!important</code> get in touch with Hamish and get some help, it&#39;s usually pretty easy to fix.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"using-a-library-when-you-could-just-write-the-code-yourself\\\">Using a library when you could just write the code yourself</h3>\\n<p>Currently, one of our biggest problems I see is bundle size. I&#39;ve seen codebases downloading 10 MB of assets on load, which is slow to begin with, but those assets still need to be parsed and read into memory by the browser. This makes apps feel slow and that means users are less likely to use your product.</p>\\n<p>The main cause of our bundle size problems is too many libraries. This is very important, we need to stop using additional libraries to solve problems we could easily solve by writing code. After all, we are developers to right?</p>\\n<p>In some cases, a library is the right option, but in a lot of cases it isn’t. I&#39;ve seen some hilarious examples of this, and have started to write a post on this specifically, enough said for now.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"using-eval\\\">Using <code>eval()</code></h3>\\n<p>Read the MDN docs, they have a good entry on this. Basically, it&#39;s a well known security risk, and should never really need to be used. You can just about always replace <code>eval()</code> with <code>window.Function()</code>.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"forgetting-to-commit-the-package-lockjson\\\">Forgetting to commit the package-lock.json</h3>\\n<p>Always commit the package-lock.json. It&#39;s how we ensure that everyone on the team is running the same versions of packages in their node_modules folder. Basically, the package-lock.json builds a list of the dependencies of the packages in your package.json, in our code bases it can be thousands of packages. If one team member is running v0.12 and another team member is running v1.01 it can lead to some one saying…</p>\\n<p>How come your local works and mine doesn’t?</p>\\n<p>These problems can be really hard to debug, and it&#39;s easy to prevent!</p>\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
