More of a guide than a rule book, hopefully you can glean some useful info and improve your approach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id="the-ideal-way-to-set-up-scss-imports-and-structure-for-fe-codebases">The Ideal Way To Set Up SCSS Imports and Structure For FE Codebases</h3>\n<p>First things first. Let’s get the order of imports in our main.js files correct.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Import any vendor styles at the top of main.js / entry point javascript file, this means any third party packages, make sure you import the .min.css version, usually found in the <code>/dist</code> directory of the packages node_module. You may need to ensure that these imports can be parsed (assuming you are not using vue-cli).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Create a folder for your global styles, I lean towards <code>/src/style/</code> then create an index file using whatever pre-processor extention you&#39;ve choosen, for me, genrally it&#39;s <code>index.sass</code>. Import the index file or whatever its called from the /style directory into the main.js / entry point javascript file, <em>after the vendor styles</em>. This order of imports is somewhat subjective dependent on your aims and use cases. I use this order because I feel like I want the ability to overwrite vendor any badly written vendor styles, leveraging the CSS hieracy rule. Ie, imported later = higher in the hieracy.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Commence JavaScript set up as usual.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That deals with all styles that are global. Next let’s quickly ensure everyone understands CSS Specificity, then we can talk about how to apply that idea to FE code bases. Have a look at <a class="sc-hDgvsY jFsdGs" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25105736/what-is-the-order-of-precedence-for-css" title="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25105736/what-is-the-order-of-precedence-for-css" >this</a>, the basic idea is to know which rule gets applied to the broswer when there is more than one option.</p>\n<p>The image below is also pretty good as a visual representation of the point I&#39;m trying to make.</p>\n<p><img src="/images/css.png" alt="CSS Specificity" title="Diagram displaying CSS Specificity"></p>\n<p>The aim of the list above the image is to place all of the vendor and pre-processed styles in the user-agent category, I am aware that the image and the examples I&#39;m providing do not share a 1:1 relationship, bear with and try to take a higher level view at this point. Think about the following examples:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-scss">// main.css\n.page-container {\n    width: 98%;\n    margin: 55px auto;\n    max-width: $page-max-width;\n    min-width: $min-width-mobile-device;\n}\n.home-page-container {\n    width: 80%;\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code class="language-html">// Home.vue\n&lt;template&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;page-container home-page-container&quot;&gt;\n        // content here\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>It’s a very simple/basic one, but the idea here is that there are two rules for the width of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Which one does the broswer choose to use?\nThis example is simple, it&#39;s the most recently used rule. So the width would be 80%. What about if I added these two items...</p>\n<pre><code class="language-scss">// main.css\n.page-container {\n    width: 98%;\n    margin: 55px auto;\n    max-width: $page-max-width;\n    min-width: $min-width-mobile-device;\n}\n.home-page-container {\n    width: 80% !important;\n}</code></pre>\n<pre><code class="language-html">// Home.vue\n&lt;template&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;page-container home-page-container&quot; style=&quot;width: 1400px;&quot;&gt;\n        // content here\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Would the width be <code>1400px</code> or <code>80%</code>?</p>\n<p>This is why the most important thing to learn in CSS is Specificity. Read the links above, even if you are the Frontend ultima, read them any way. Here is the very short version, in order of importance (meaning items at the bottom of the list will always override items higher up than them).</p>\n<h3 id="styles-being-used-within-vue-single-file-components">Styles Being Used Within Vue Single File Components</h3>\n<p>So following on from the ideas above, the styles I&#39;m about to talk about will be nearer the bottom of the items in the image. Namely; Document, inline and computed styles. Again, not a 1:1 relationship becuase styles that use the Vue <code>scoped</code> attribute effectively short circuit that list, but let&#39;s press on and things will become more clear.</p>\n<p>Here is the list of style instances that you will end up using in a typical vue-cli codebase, in the same format as the image - lower in the list will override items higher in the list.</p>\n<ol class="ak-ol">\n    <li>\n        Styles written inside Vue style blocks.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Styles written inside Vue `scoped` style blocks.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Inline styles written on HTML elements using the standard HTML syntax, but in our case this would most likely become styles added by the Vue `style` attribute.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Styles written via Javscript.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Which should bring us to a place where the traditional model - shown in the hieracy image above - is now replaced by our new paradigm.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Things to keep in mind. The order in which we import things is important, especially in complex SPA applications like ours. So, we import the third party stuff first, so we can easily override it if we want to customise, and so we don&#39;t have to use !important or an inline style to do so. After the imports are set, then the hieracy within our SFC is basically (from low to high): Style blocks, Scoped Style Blocks, Vue <code>style</code> attribute, html inline <code>style</code> attribute (these two have slighly different syntax) finally styles written via Javascript.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id="a-note-on-performance-in-dev-envs">A Note On Performance In Dev Envs</h3>\n<p>Want to use a hot reload in dev that takes 20ms instead of 3s...?</p>\n<p>I suggest trying to minimise the amount of CSS pre-processing you are performing. Use vendor styles that are already compiled and import them early to allow for ease of override. Recently I worked with a code base that made no use of <code>scoped</code> style blocks and contained a vast number of .scss files (around 8k lines when compiled). The hot reload was so slow that it became useless, as it was faster to switch tabs and hit refresh in the browser. After completing the steps described above, the hot-reload was back down to matter of milliseconds. It works.</p>\n<h3 id="write-better-scss---how-to-use-your-global-style-directory">Write better SCSS - How To Use Your Global Style Directory</h3>\n<p>In a perfect world, the /style directory would contain three things:</p>\n<ol class="ak-ol">\n    <li>\n        Variables\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Mixins\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Default styles written in a very general fashion (examples below)\n    </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Default styles might look something like this...</p>\n<pre><code class="language-scss">// input.scss\ninput {\n    font-size: 1.2em;\n    border-bottom: 1px solid $medium-gray;\n    border-top: none;\n    border-left: none;\n    border-right: none;\n    border-radius: 0;\n    font-size: 1.2em;\n    padding: 7px 0;\n    outline: none;\n    &amp;:hover {\n        border-bottom: 1px solid $medium-gray;\n        border-top: none;\n        border-left: none;\n        border-right: none;\n    }\n    &amp;:focus {\n        border-bottom: 1px solid $secondary;\n        border-top: none;\n        border-left: none;\n        border-right: none;\n        box-shadow: none;\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The goal here is write styles that apply to most <code>&lt;inputs&gt;</code> they could be based on the values from your organisations design guide, possibly. You are trying to acheieve a set up that makes it possible to simply put a <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element on the page, and not have to write any additional styles in your SFC, unless something about this specific input calls for something different from the usual design guide inspired <code>&lt;input/&gt;</code>. Maybe the ticket you are working on calls for the :foucs on the input to be red... Thats when you write your styles in the <code>&lt;style scoped&gt;</code> block of your Vue component.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-sass">// Example of what a typography.sass file might look like\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6\n    line-height: 1.5\n    font-weight: lighter\n    font-family: $heading-font\n\nh1\n    font-size: $h1-fontsize\n    line-height: 110%\n    margin: ($h1-fontsize / 2.3) 0 ($h2-fontsize / 2.9) 0\n    @media (min-width: 520px) and (max-width: 1080px)\n        font-size: ($h1-fontsize / 1.3)\n    @media (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 520px)\n        font-size: ($h1-fontsize / 2.3)\n\nh2\n    font-size: $h2-fontsize\n    line-height: 110%\n    margin: ($h2-fontsize / 2.3) 0 ($h2-fontsize / 2.9) 0\nh3\n    font-size: $h3-fontsize\n    line-height: 110%\n    margin: ($h3-fontsize / 2.3) 0 ($h2-fontsize / 2.9) 0\nh4\n    font-size: $h4-fontsize\n    line-height: 110%\n    margin: ($h4-fontsize / 2.3) 0 ($h2-fontsize / 2.9) 0\nh5\n    font-size: $h5-fontsize\n    line-height: 110%\n    margin: ($h5-fontsize / 2.3) 0 ($h2-fontsize / 2.9) 0\nh6\n    font-size: $h6-fontsize\n    line-height: 110%\n    margin: ($h6-fontsize / 2.3) 0 ($h2-fontsize / 2.9) 0\n\na\n    text-decoration: none\n    color: $link\n    font-family: $body-font\n    &amp;:hover\n        color: darken($link, 10)\n\np\n    font-size: 1.5em\n    @media (min-width: 520px) and (max-width: 1080px)\n        font-size: 1.2em\n    @media (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 520px)\n        font-size: 1em\nstrong\n    font-weight: bold\nsmall\n    font-size: 75%\n    .light\n        font-weight: 300\n    .thin\n        font-weight: 200</code></pre>\n<p>The goal here is to set reasoanbly wide defaults that apply in <em>most</em> cases. The desired result is reduce the amount of styles being written in our SFC. The same as the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> example above, if for some reason an atypical <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> was require, that is when you would be using the <code>scoped</code> style block in your SFC.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What we are trying to do here is achieve a system where we build smart defaults, that work in as many cases as possible, then when overrides are required, we have the awesome power of the Vue <code>scoped</code> style blocks. This will mean our CSS bundle stays small and we don&#39;t spend time fighting our CSS. It takes a bit of time to understand but once you hit grok, it&#39;s a big win for developer satisfaction - and lead time will drop as well!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All told.</p>\n'}}]);
